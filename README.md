# PastureMap Coding Challenge

To run, I used the package http-server to spin up a local server to host index.html.

You can find the package here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

If you run `http-server` in this project's root directory, you should be able to visit localhost:8080 by default to view the app.
